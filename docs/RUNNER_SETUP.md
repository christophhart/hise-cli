# Self-hosted runner setup

One-time bootstrap for each macOS / Windows runner that powers the release
pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Without these prerequisites, the
codesign, notarize, or Inno Setup steps will fail.

The runner labels expected by the workflow are the GitHub defaults
(`self-hosted` + `macOS` / `Windows`).

## macOS runner

### Toolchain

```bash
brew install bun           # or: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
brew install node          # or any Node 18+
```

Verify `bun --version` and `node --version` print versions in a fresh shell.
If you installed bun manually after the runner service was started, restart
the runner so it inherits the updated `PATH`.

### Code signing certs

Two distinct Developer ID certs from the Apple Developer portal:

- **Developer ID Application** — signs the Mach-O binary
- **Developer ID Installer** — signs the `.pkg`

Both go into the runner user's login keychain. After importing, run a
test `codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: ..."` and a test
`pkgbuild --sign "Developer ID Installer: ..."` interactively, and click
**Always Allow** on the keychain prompt for each. That ACL is what lets the
non-interactive workflow bypass the password dialog.

### Notarization profile

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials notarize \
  --apple-id "you@example.com" \
  --team-id "PF9H8PK77F" \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"   # app-specific password
```

The profile name (`notarize`) is what the workflow's
`--keychain-profile notarize` flag references. App-specific passwords are
generated at appleid.apple.com.

Verify with `xcrun notarytool history --keychain-profile notarize`.

### Login keychain

The login keychain must be **unlocked** when the workflow runs. If the runner
machine sleeps or you log out, the keychain locks and codesign starts
prompting again. Options: keep the runner machine awake + logged in, or
unlock in the workflow:

```yaml
- run: security unlock-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PWD" ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

(Adds a `KEYCHAIN_PWD` repo secret. Only worth it if interactive sessions
aren't viable.)

## Windows runner

### Toolchain

```powershell
# Bun
irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex

# Node + npm
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Inno Setup (per-user install — note path)
winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup
```

Verify `bun --version`, `node --version`, `npm --version`, and `iscc /?` all
work in a fresh PowerShell session.

### PowerShell execution policy

`npm.ps1` won't load under the default `Restricted` policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### PATH for `iscc`

`winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup` installs to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6` and does **not** add it to `PATH`.
Two options:

1. Permanent (preferred — no per-workflow boilerplate):
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
     "PATH",
     "$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH','User'));$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Inno Setup 6",
     "User"
   )
   ```
   Restart the runner so it inherits the updated `PATH`.

2. Per-workflow (already wired in `release.yml`):
   ```yaml
   - run: echo "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Inno Setup 6" >> $env:GITHUB_PATH
   ```

### Restart after PATH changes

Self-hosted runners cache the environment they were launched with. Any time
you install something new (bun, node, Inno Setup) or change `PATH`, restart
the runner service:

```powershell
.\svc.cmd stop
.\svc.cmd start
```

(Or kill `Runner.Listener` and re-launch `run.cmd`.)

## Both platforms

### Persistent state

The workflow uses `npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund` (not
`npm ci`). On a fresh checkout the first install is full; subsequent runs
are near-instant because `node_modules/` persists between jobs on
self-hosted runners.

### Upgrading the runner

Single self-hosted runner version per machine — keep it current with GitHub
periodically (`./config.sh remove`, re-download tarball, re-register). The
release pipeline doesn't depend on any specific runner version.
