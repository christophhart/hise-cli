	builder: `hise-cli -builder — module tree editor

SYNTAX
  hise-cli -builder "<command>"
  hise-cli -builder --target:<path> "<command>"

QUICK START
  hise-cli -builder show tree              inspect current modules
  hise-cli -builder add SimpleGain         add at root (auto-picked chain)
  hise-cli -builder add LFO to MyGain      add under an existing module
  hise-cli -builder show types script      filter types by substring

  Notes:
    - add <type> works without "to <parent>" — root is the default.
    - Chain (.fx/.gain/...) is auto-resolved from the module's category;
      only Modulators require explicit chain (e.g. "to Master.gain").
    - On Windows Git Bash, both "show tree" (quoted) and show tree
      (unquoted) work — the CLI strips matching outer quotes defensively.

MODULE TREE CONCEPTS
  HISE organises audio processing as a tree of modules. Every project has
  a root SoundGenerator (typically "Master Chain") with child modules
  nested inside typed slots called chains:

    children   Sound generators and containers (the main signal path)
    fx         Effect processors (filters, reverbs, delays)
    midi       MIDI processors (arpeggiators, scripts, transposes)
    gain       Gain modulators (LFOs, envelopes on volume)
    pitch      Pitch modulators (vibrato, glide)

  Each module type can only be added to a compatible chain. The builder
  validates this locally using constrainer rules from the module database.
  Use "show types" to discover available types and "show tree" to see
  the current hierarchy.

  A fresh project typically has: Master Chain (SynthGroup) → children
  contains one or more sound generators, each with their own fx/midi/gain
  chains.

COMMANDS
  add <type> [as "<name>"] [to <parent>[.<chain>]]
    Add a module. <type> is a module type name (tab-completable).
    Without "to", adds to the current context (cd target or root).
    Chain is auto-resolved from the module category:
      SoundGenerator types  → parent.children
      Effect types          → parent.fx
      MidiProcessor types   → parent.midi
      Modulator types       → requires explicit .chain (e.g. .gain, .pitch)
    Modules are appended to the end of the chain. Reordering is not
    supported — remove and re-add to change position.
    Name collisions are auto-suffixed (e.g. "LFO", "LFO2", "LFO3").
    Without "to" and no cd context, adds to the root container.
    All add/remove/set/clone operations are undoable (see -undo --help).

  remove <target>
    Remove a module and all its children from the tree.

  clone <target> [x<count>]
    Duplicate a module (with all children and parameters).
    x<count> creates multiple copies: clone LFO x3

  rename <target> to "<name>"
    Change a module's display name.

  set <target>.<param> [to] <value>
    Set a parameter. <target> is the module instance name (unique
    across the tree — no path needed, just the ID).
    <param> is the parameter name (both tab-completable).
    "to" is optional: "set Master.Volume -6" works.

  bypass <target> / enable <target>
    Toggle a module's bypass state.

  load "<source>" into <target>
    Load a preset, sample map, or other data file into a module.
    <source> is a quoted file path or resource identifier.

  show tree
    Print the full module tree with types, IDs, and chain structure.

  show types [<filter>]
    List all available module types. Optional filter is a case-insensitive
    substring match against the Module ID, Type, and Subtype columns
    (e.g. "show types script" returns ScriptFX, ScriptProcessor, etc.).
    Returns a one-line "(no module types match ...)" message when no row
    matches, instead of an empty table.

  show <target>
    Show a module's parameters with current values and ranges.

  reset
    Wipe the entire module tree and clear undo history.
    This is irreversible — use with caution.

  cd <path> / ls / pwd
    Navigate the tree. "cd Master Chain" sets context so subsequent
    commands target that module. "ls" lists children. "pwd" shows
    the current path. Use "/exit" to return to root.

COMMA CHAINING
  Multiple commands in one call, separated by commas:
    add LFO to Master.gain, set LFO.Frequency to 2.0
  Target inheritance: "set Master.Volume to -6, Pan to 10" reuses Master.

CONTEXT TARGET
  --target sets an implicit parent without entering the mode:
    hise-cli -builder --target:Master "add LFO to gain"

NAMING
  add SimpleGain as "MyGain" to Master Chain
  Without "as", the module gets the type ID as its instance name.

MOCK MODE
  --mock simulates a full module tree (SynthGroup with 23 modules).
  add/remove/set/clone modify the simulated tree and return diffs.
  Use "show tree" with --mock to see the simulated hierarchy.

UNDO
  All tree mutations (add, remove, set, clone, rename, bypass) are
  undoable via the undo mode. See: hise-cli -undo --help
  Plan groups batch multiple operations into a single undo step.

RESPONSE FORMAT
  Successful mutations return a diff summary: { ok: true, result: "+ModuleId" }
  for add, "-ModuleId" for remove, "*ModuleId.Param" for set.
  Use "show tree" or "show <target>" after mutations to inspect the result.

ERROR HANDLING
  Invalid type names, nonexistent targets, and chain constraint violations
  return JSON with ok:false and an error message.
  If HISE is not running (and --mock is not set), returns a connection error.

MODULE TYPE IDS
  The add command uses type IDs as returned by "show types". IDs are
  single tokens (e.g. SimpleGain, AHDSR, LFO, SineSynth).
  "show types" returns columns: Module (ID), Type (category), Subtype,
  Category (tags). The Type column tells you the chain mapping:
    SoundGenerator → children, Effect → fx, MidiProcessor → midi,
    Modulator → explicit chain required.

  Common types (partial — run "show types" for the full list):
  SoundGenerators: SineSynth, WaveSynth, Noise, StreamingSampler,
    SynthGroup, GlobalModulatorContainer, SilentSynth
  Effects: SimpleGain, SimpleReverb, HardcodedMasterFX, PolyphonicFilter,
    Convolution, StereoFX, Dynamics, Saturator, Delay, ShapeFX,
    ScriptFX (hosts a DspNetwork — add this before calling -dsp init)
  MidiProcessors: ScriptProcessor, Transposer, Arpeggiator, MidiPlayer
  Modulators: LFO, AHDSR, Velocity, TableEnvelope, Constant, Random,
    SimpleEnvelope, MidiController, KeyNumber

CHAIN TYPES (exhaustive list)
  children   Main signal path (sound generators, containers)
  fx         Effect processors
  midi       MIDI processors
  gain       Gain/volume modulators
  pitch      Pitch modulators
  These are the only chain types. No custom chains exist.

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW (complex module trees)
  Use undo plan groups to batch operations into a single undoable unit:
    1. hise-cli -undo 'plan "Add synth layer"'
    2. hise-cli -builder "add SineSynth as \"Lead\" to Master Chain"
    3. hise-cli -builder "add SimpleGain to Lead"
    4. hise-cli -builder "add AHDSR to Lead.gain"
    5. hise-cli -builder "set Lead.Volume to -6"
    6. hise-cli -builder "show tree"
    7. hise-cli -undo "apply"            (or "discard" to rollback all)

  This ensures the entire module group is added or reverted atomically.
  Always verify with "show tree" before applying.

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli -builder "show tree"
  hise-cli -builder "show types"
  hise-cli -builder "show types Envelope"
  hise-cli -builder "add SimpleGain as \"MyGain\" to Master Chain"
  hise-cli -builder "add AHDSR to MyGain.gain"
  hise-cli -builder "set Master Chain.Volume to -6"
  hise-cli -builder "clone MyGain x2"
  hise-cli -builder "remove MyGain"
  hise-cli -builder "show Master Chain"
  hise-cli -builder --target:Master "add LFO to gain, set LFO.Frequency to 4.0"
  hise-cli -builder "reset"`,

	dsp: `hise-cli -dsp — scriptnode graph editor

SYNTAX
  hise-cli -dsp "<command>"
  hise-cli -dsp --target:<moduleId> "<command>"

MODULE CONTEXT
  Every DSP command is scoped to a "moduleId" — the script processor that
  hosts the DspNetwork. Each host carries at most one active network.

  Pass the host via --target:, or prefix commands with "use <moduleId>"
  in a multi-statement run.

NETWORK LIFECYCLE
  show networks                  List .xml files under DspNetworks/
  show modules                   List DspNetwork-capable script processors
  show <nodeId>                  Inspect one node: header, properties,
                                 parameter values with range/default, and
                                 incoming/outgoing modulation edges.
  use <moduleId>                 Switch the host context
  load <name>                    Load an existing network. Errors if the
                                 <name>.xml file does not exist.
  create <name>                  Create a new network. Errors if <name>.xml
                                 already exists on disk. Prevents silent
                                 layering onto a stale schema.
  init <name>                    Load-or-create catch-all. Output states
                                 "Loaded existing" vs "Created new" so the
                                 path taken is explicit.
  save                           Persist the loaded network to its .xml
  reset                          Empty the loaded network in memory

GRAPH EDITING
  add <factory.node> [as <id>] [to <parent>] [at <index>]
    Add a node. Factory paths use dot notation (core.oscillator,
    filters.svf, control.pma). Without "to", adds to the current cd path.
    "at <index>" inserts at a specific position within the parent
    container (default is append).
  remove <nodeId>
  move <nodeId> to <parent> [at <index>]
  connect <src>[.<output>] to <target>[.<param>] [matched]
    <output> defaults to the first modulation output when omitted.
    <param> may be omitted for routing shorthand (e.g. "connect SEND to RCV");
    HISE resolves the default target server-side.
    "matched" (alias "normalize") copies the target parameter's range
    onto the source after wiring (mirrors the IDE normalize button).
  disconnect <src> from <target>.<param>
  set <node>.<param> [to] <value>
    Value-write. Range is pre-validated against scriptnodeList.json.
  set <node>.<param> range <min> <max> [step <s>] [mid <m>|skew <s>]
    Full range-write. Overrides the parameter's declared range without
    changing its value. mid (middlePosition) and skew (skewFactor) are
    mutually exclusive.
  set <node>.<param>.<min|max|step|mid|skew> <number>
    Single-field range-write. Reads existing range from the cached tree,
    overrides the named field, and emits a full range-write payload.
  set <root>.<NetworkProp> <value>
    Network-level property write (only valid when <root> is the network
    root node). Recognized props: AllowCompilation, AllowPolyphonic,
    HasTail, SuspendOnSilence (boolean), CompileChannelAmount (int),
    ModulationBlockSize (power-of-two int or 0).
  bypass <nodeId> | enable <nodeId>
  create_parameter <container>.<name> [<min> <max>] [default <d>] [step <s>] [mid <m>|skew <s>]
    Creates a dynamic parameter on a container node. mid and skew are
    mutually exclusive.

FIELD ALIASES
  step    accepts step | stepSize | interval
  mid     accepts mid | middlePosition
  skew    accepts skew | skewFactor

LOCAL QUERIES (no API round-trip)
  get <nodeId>                   -> factory path
  get <node>.<param>             -> current parameter value
  get source of <node>.<param>   -> connected source id (or "(not connected)")
  get parent of <node>.<param>   -> parent container id

NAVIGATION
  cd <container>                 Step into a container
  cd .. / cd /                   Step out / jump to root
  ls                             List children at the current path
  pwd                            Print the current path

SCREENSHOT
  screenshot [at <scale>] [to <path>]
    Render the current host's DspNetwork graph to a PNG. Path is resolved
    relative to the project's Images/ folder (or absolute) and must end in
    .png. Scale accepts percentage (50%) or decimal (0.5); valid values
    are 0.5, 1.0, 2.0. Defaults to screenshot.png at scale 1.0. Requires
    the HISE IDE UI to be open.

COMMA CHAINING
  set A.Freq 440, B.Freq 880     Verb inheritance across comma segments

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "show tree"
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "create MyDSP"      # fresh, fail if exists
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "load MyDSP"        # open existing
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "init MyDSP"        # load-or-create
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "add core.oscillator as Osc1, set Osc1.Frequency 440"
  hise-cli -dsp --target:"Script FX1" "add filters.svf as F1"

	run: `hise-cli --run — script runner & test framework

SYNTAX
  hise-cli --run <file.hsc>                      Execute a .hsc script file
  hise-cli --run --inline "<script>"             Execute an inline script string
  hise-cli --run - < script.hsc                  Execute script from stdin
  hise-cli --run <file.hsc> --mock               Execute with mock HISE connection
  hise-cli --run <file.hsc> --dry-run            Validate only (no execution)
  hise-cli --run <file.hsc> --verbosity=<level>  Control output detail (default: summary)

VERBOSITY LEVELS
  verbose   Full per-command logs + /expect rows + PASSED N/N footer
  summary   (default) Only /expect rows + PASSED N/N footer per script
  quiet     Single ✓/✗ pass-fail line per script (footer only)

  Aliases: --verbose = --verbosity=verbose, --quiet = --verbosity=quiet

SCRIPT SOURCES
  File:   hise-cli --run test.hsc
  Inline: hise-cli --run --inline "/builder\nadd SineSynth\n/script\n/expect Engine.getSampleRate() is 44100"
  Stdin:  echo "/script" | hise-cli --run -
          hise-cli --run - <<'EOF'
          /builder
          add SineSynth
          EOF

  The --inline flag is designed for LLM tool use where the script is passed
  as a JSON string argument with literal \n newlines — no shell quoting issues.

PATH RESOLUTION
  Absolute path        Used as-is (e.g. /home/u/test.hsc, C:/proj/test.hsc)
  ./ or ../ prefix     Resolved against current working directory
  Bare relative path   Resolved against the HISE project folder
                       Requires HISE to be running with a project open

  Examples:
    hise-cli --run ./test.hsc          # ./test.hsc relative to shell CWD
    hise-cli --run Scripts/test.hsc    # <project>/Scripts/test.hsc
    hise-cli --run /tmp/test.hsc       # absolute, unchanged

  If HISE is not running and the path is bare-relative, --run aborts with
  an error rather than silently falling back to CWD.

.HSC SCRIPT FORMAT
  Each line is a command. Lines starting with # are comments.
  Empty lines are ignored. Leading whitespace is stripped (cosmetic only).
  Mode switches (/builder, /script, etc.) persist across lines.

  Shebang support: add #!/usr/bin/env hise-cli run as the first line
  to make .hsc files directly executable on Unix (chmod +x test.hsc).

TOOL COMMANDS (available in scripts and TUI)
  /wait <duration>           Pause (e.g., /wait 500ms, /wait 0.5s)
  /expect <cmd> is <value>   Assert a command's result
  /callback <name>           In /script, collect raw callback body lines
  /compile                   In /script, compile collected callbacks
  /export                    Enter export mode (build targets)
    Float tolerance: default 0.01, customize with "within <tol>"
    Abort on failure: append "or abort"

ERROR HANDLING
  Parse phase:   Multi-recovery — all syntax errors reported together
  Runtime phase: Fail-fast — aborts on first error
  /expect:       Continues on failure (collects all results)
                 Unless "or abort" is specified

EXAMPLE SCRIPT (test.hsc)
  # Set up a module tree
  /builder
  add SineSynth as MySynth
  set MySynth.Volume -6

  # Verify parameter
  /expect get MySynth.Volume is -6

  # Test script evaluation
  /script
  /expect Engine.getSampleRate() is 44100 within 1

  # Compile callbacks
  /callback onInit
  Content.makeFrontInterface(600, 600);
  /callback onNoteOn
  Console.print(Message.getNoteNumber());
  /compile

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON)
  { "ok": true|false, "value": {
    "linesExecuted": 8,
    "expects": [
      { "line": 7, "command": "...", "expected": "...", "actual": "...", "passed": true }
    ],
    "error": null
  }}

SHEBANG (Unix)
  Make .hsc files directly executable:
    #!/usr/bin/env hise-cli run
    /script
    /expect Engine.getSampleRate() is 44100

  Then: chmod +x test.hsc && ./test.hsc

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli --run test.hsc                        # summary (default)
  hise-cli --run test.hsc --verbose              # full per-command logs
  hise-cli --run test.hsc --quiet                # single pass/fail line
  hise-cli --run Examples/sn.hsc --verbosity=summary
  hise-cli --run test.hsc --mock
  hise-cli --run test.hsc --dry-run`,

	diagnose: `hise-cli diagnose — HiseScript shadow parser diagnostics

SYNTAX
  hise-cli diagnose <filepath> [--format=pretty|json] [--errors-only]

Runs the HISE shadow parser on a script file and returns diagnostics.
Accepts an absolute file path — the CLI resolves it to a project-relative
path automatically.

The file must be included in a ScriptProcessor and compiled at least once
for diagnostics to be available. If the file is in the scripts folder but
not yet included, a warning is returned.

OPTIONS
  --format=json      JSON output (default)
  --format=pretty    Human-readable file:line:col format on stderr
  --errors-only      Filter to error-severity diagnostics only

EXIT CODES
  0    No errors (or file not in project)
  1    Errors found (JSON mode) or connection failure
  2    Errors found (pretty mode) — Claude Code hook "block" signal

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON, default)
  { "ok": false, "file": "/path/to/script.js", "diagnostics": [
    { "line": 6, "column": 15, "severity": "error",
      "source": "api-validation",
      "message": "Function / constant not found: Console.prins",
      "suggestions": ["print"] }
  ]}

OUTPUT FORMAT (pretty, --format=pretty)
  /path/to/script.js:6:15: error: Function / constant not found: Console.prins (did you mean: print?)

CLAUDE CODE HOOK
  Create ~/.claude/hise-lsp.sh:
    #!/bin/bash
    INPUT=$(cat)
    FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')
    if [[ "$FILE" == */Scripts/*.js ]]; then
      DIAG=$(hise-cli diagnose "$FILE" --format=pretty --errors-only 2>&1)
      if [ -n "$DIAG" ]; then
        echo "" >&2
        echo "$DIAG" >&2
        exit 2
      fi
    fi

  Add to ~/.claude/settings.json (global hook):
    { "hooks": { "PostToolUse": [{ "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
          "command": "bash ~/.claude/hise-lsp.sh" }] }] } }

  hise-cli diagnose /path/to/Scripts/ext.js
  hise-cli diagnose /path/to/Scripts/ext.js --format=pretty --errors-only
  hise-cli diagnose --help`,

	hise: `hise-cli -hise — HISE runtime control

SYNTAX
  hise-cli -hise "<command>"

COMMANDS
  launch [debug]                                   Start HISE and wait for connection
  shutdown                                         Gracefully quit HISE
  screenshot [of <id>] [at <scale>] [to <path>]    Capture interface screenshot
  profile [thread audio|ui|scripting] [for <N>ms]  Record performance profile
  playground open|close|enable|disable             Control the snippet browser

LAUNCH
  Finds HISE (or "HISE Debug") on PATH, spawns it, and polls /api/status
  until the server responds (10s timeout). Case-insensitive "debug" flag.

SCREENSHOT
  Captures the full interface or a specific component. Output path is
  resolved relative to the HISE project folder. Defaults to screenshot.png
  in the project root. Scale accepts both percentage (50%) and decimal (0.5).

PROFILE
  Records a performance profile for the given duration (default 1000ms),
  then displays a summary table sorted by peak duration. Thread names
  are case-insensitive: audio, ui, scripting (or script).

PLAYGROUND
  Drives a second HISE instance dedicated to browsing and auditioning
  snippets. While the snippet browser is active, runtime endpoints
  (list_components, repl, recompile, ...) target the snippet, not the
  main project. 'open' creates and switches to the snippet browser;
  'close' destroys it; 'enable'/'disable' switch between the two without
  destroying the snippet (errors if no snippet exists).

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli -hise "launch"
  hise-cli -hise "launch debug"
  hise-cli -hise "screenshot"
  hise-cli -hise "screenshot of Knob1 at 50% to images/knob.png"
  hise-cli -hise "profile thread audio for 2000ms"
  hise-cli -hise "playground open"
  hise-cli -hise "playground disable"
  hise-cli -hise "shutdown"`,

	publish: `hise-cli -publish — build & sign plugin installers

SYNTAX
  hise-cli -publish "<command>"

VERBS
  check system               Run preflight (admin, project_info.xml,
                             discovered binaries, ISCC/pkgbuild,
                             optional certs).
  check binaries <list>      Assert >=1 binary present per CSV target
                             (VST3,AU,AAX,Standalone). Compares versions
                             with project_info.xml.

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli -publish "check system"
  hise-cli -publish "check binaries VST3,AU"
  hise-cli -publish "build with codesign=1, notarize=1"

EQUIVALENT WIZARD
  /wizard build_installer    Same wizard, opens the form-based UI.

RELATED
  /project export project --default     Produces the binaries that /publish
                                        then packages.

NOTES
  - On Windows, AAX signing uses a self-signed PACE keyfile auto-generated
    on first sign (separate from any Authenticode code-signing cert).
  - On macOS, the developer's Developer ID Application identity is used
    for both binary signing and AAX wraptool --signid.
  - HISE_AAX_PASSWORD env var is required when AAX is in the payload.`,

	assets: `hise-cli -assets — package manager (install / uninstall / cleanup)

SYNTAX
  hise-cli -assets "<command>"

VERBS
  list [installed|uninstalled|local|store]   List packages by category.
  info <name>                                Show installation state.
  install <name> [--version=X.Y.Z] [--dry-run]
                                             Install or upgrade a package.
                                             <name> resolves against local
                                             folders first, then the store.
                                             Register local folders first via
                                             "local add <path>".
  uninstall <name>                           Remove an installed package.
  cleanup <name>                             Force-remove user-modified files
                                             from a NeedsCleanup uninstall.
  local add <path>                           Register a local HISE project as
                                             a package source.
  local remove <name|path>                   Unregister a local folder.
  auth login --token=<t>                     Persist a HISE store token.
  auth logout                                Clear the persisted token.
  help                                       Show available commands.

EXAMPLES
  hise-cli -assets "list installed"
  hise-cli -assets "info synth_blocks"
  hise-cli -assets "install synth_blocks --version=1.2.0 --dry-run"
  hise-cli -assets "install synth_blocks --local=/path/to/source"
  hise-cli -assets "uninstall synth_blocks"
  hise-cli -assets "cleanup synth_blocks"
  hise-cli -assets "local add /path/to/MyLib"
  hise-cli -assets "auth login --token=abc123"

NOTES
  - Install resolves <name> against local folders first, then the store.
  - --dry-run previews changes without writing files or mutating HISE.
  - Modified files block re-install; run cleanup first.
  - Store install reads token from HISE_STORE_TOKEN env var, then
    persisted storeToken.dat. Use \`auth login --token=<t>\` to persist.
  - HISE must be running for asset commands (settings + preprocessor edits
    go through HISE's REST API).`,
